                    <h3>Understanding HTML: The Backbone of the Web</h3>
                    <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the fundamental building block of the World Wide Web. It
                        is the standard language used to create and design web pages and web applications. Developed by
                        Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, HTML has evolved significantly over the years, with HTML5 being the
                        latest major version. This article delves into the basics of HTML, its structure, key elements,
                        and its importance in web development.</p>
                    <h4>What is HTML?</h4>
                    <p>HTML is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the Internet. Unlike
                        programming languages that execute complex algorithms and processes, HTML focuses on the layout
                        and formatting of a webpage. It uses a series of elements and tags to instruct the browser on
                        how to display the content.</p>

                    <h4>Structure of an HTML Document</h4>
                    <pre>
    1. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML.
    2. &lt;html&gt;: The root element that encompasses the entire HTML document.
    3. &lt;head&gt;: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character set, styles, and links to scripts and external resources.
    4. &lt;title&gt;: Sets the title of the webpage, which appears on the browser tab.
    5. &lt;body&gt;: Contains the content of the webpage, such as text, images, links, and other media.
                    </pre>
                    <h4>Key HTML Elements</h4>
                    <pre>
    1. Headings (&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;): Define the headings of the document, with &lt;h1&gt; being the highest (or most important) level and &lt;h6&gt; the lowest.
    2. Paragraph (&lt;p&gt;): Represents a block of text.
    3. Links (&lt;a&gt;): Creates hyperlinks to other documents or parts of the same document.
    4. Images (&lt;img&gt;): Embeds images in the webpage.
    5. Lists (&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;li&gt;): Defines unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists.
    6. Tables (&lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, &lt;th&gt;): Structures data in a tabular format.
